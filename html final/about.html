 	<h2>The field</h2>
<p>
Hotel Management (HM) is a multidisciplinary field of study with the purpose of preparing people with the expertise, commitment, and skills for management, marketing, and operations positions in the expanding industry that provides food, accommodations, and tourism services to people away from home. It draws upon a wide range of basic disciplines to provide the fundamental knowledge and skills that are required to fulfill the diverse demands placed upon individuals in management positions within the hospitality industry.

Recognizing that the individual educated for today is soon out of date, the academic emphasis of the program is on principles, analytical tools, processes, and systems. Likewise, it is recognized that the students in the program are composites of many talents, and that in hospitality and tourism, pure academic ability cannot predict professional success.


Thus, the program has as a basic objective the presentation of an academic curriculum to develop management capability through interdisciplinary subject exposure, problem identification, basic concepts, decision making, theory, and management application. In addition, students are encouraged to develop English language skills to better prepare for this increasingly international industry.
